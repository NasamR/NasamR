- 👋 Hi, I’m @NasamR.
- 📌 In the near future I will post here some of my projects. 
- 🔧 Probably, they will be from different areas: python, microcontrollers, 3D printing, etc. From very simple to more complex.
- 📺 I will try to describe the development process in detail and attach more photos.
- 🔨 Some of the projects have already been done and dismantled for parts, so, probably, there will be only a photo of the finished project and a description.
- 📫 I'm available on telegram (@NasamR) and linkedin (Nasam Ragip).
