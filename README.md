- 👋 Hi, I’m @NasamR.
- 👀 I’m interested in working with data by using python (dealing with missing values, descriptive statistics, plots, predictive models and etc.).
- 🌱 I’m currently reading "Statistics in a Nutshell", 2nd Edition (by Sarah Boslaugh). I read every day, beacuse i believe that the learning process is continuous and should flow throughout life.
- 💞️ I would love to meet like-minded people interested in development in data analysis, in any of its areas. It is faster and more interesting to learn something when you work with people.
- 📫 I'm available on telegram (@NasamR) and linkedin (Nasam Ragip).
