- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NasamR.
- ðŸ“Œ In the near future I will post here some of my projects. 
- ðŸ”§ Probably, they will be from different areas: python, microcontrollers, 3D printing, etc. From very simple to more complex.
- ðŸ“º I will try to describe the development process in detail and attach more photos.
- ðŸ”¨ Some of the projects have already been done and dismantled for parts, so, probably, there will be only a photo of the finished project and a description.
